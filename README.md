•	Developed a computer vision project that converts regular images into sketch-like representations.

•	Utilizes image processing techniques to achieve the sketch effect.

•	The project applies edge detection algorithms to identify and enhance image edges, creating a sketch-like appearance.

•	Allows users to adjust parameters for edge detection strength and sketch thickness for customizability.

•	Offers a user-friendly interface for users to upload their images and apply the sketching effect.

•	Provides real-time rendering to display the sketch version of the image instantly.

•	Demonstrates the power of computer vision in simulating the art of sketching and artistic representation from photographs.

•	Offers a creative and visually appealing way for users to transform their images into sketch-like masterpieces.

•	Can be further extended to include additional features, such as pencil texture simulation or color customization for artistic exploration.
